# Budgety JavaScript Udemy Project
Budgety is a JavaScript CRUD application that lets a user create money amounts and descriptions, the application reads those inputs and then updates the user interface, and then the user can delete an input they previously created. The app stores user inputs (Income or an Expense) and outputs their balance based on their inputs. Budgety also automatically updates the date located at the top of the screen so that users know what month they are budgeting for.
